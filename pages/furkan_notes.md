# Act 1

## Charles Babbage

- He was born in 1791. He graduated from University of Cambridge in 1814. He had a hard time finding
  a job for a while.
- After the graduation, he relied on his father's support, and when his father died he inherited
  about $15M in today's value.
- He helped found the Royal Astronomical Society. They goal was to standardize astronomical
  calculations and circulate data.
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Astronomical_Society
- Here, he was asked to improve the data in The British Nautical Almanac. Babbage and John Herschel
  were asked to run a trial project. Babbage and Herschel employed two human computers to prepare
  copies of the tables. They discovered discrepancies in the tables. And in around 1821-1822,
  Babbage brought up the idea of "calculating by steam". Its purpose was to just calculate these
  tables and nothing else.
> https://books.google.ca/books?id=g8uvNtuPhgUC&pg=PA320&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false
> An [Almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac) is apparently published information about
> various subjects like weather, farming, tide tables etc.
- He also contributed to the establishment of a postal system in Britian, economics,
- In 1812, the French government calculated these tables in a different way. Their mathematicians
  distributed the work to 80 human computers who only knew what work they were doing and subtraction
  and addition. For the first time, mass production was applied to mathematics and Babbage thought
  this work could be taken over by machines entirely.
- The Difference Engine was designed by him but it was never built because the machinist responsible
  for building the machine refused to do it unless he was prepaid. The machinist who was building it
  Joseph Clement. He was one of the greatest at the time, and the tools he built were high quality.
  He demanded too much money and they didn't finish the project.
> Q: How much money did he ask for? Why didn't he get the money?
- He later designed the Analytical Engine. This was an even bigger and more complicated machine. It
  was steam run and operated by one person.
> The memory unit was to be large enough to hold 1,000 50-digit numbers; this was larger than the
> storage capacity of any computer built before 1960.
- Analytical Engine was never built either. The design was forgotten until his unpublished notes
  were discovered in 1937.
- He was part of [The Ghost Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_Club). It seems that this
  club is still "active" in their investigations.

### Difference Engine

- The difference engine's purpose was to help with the nautical almanac.
- This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed fifteen
  short tons (13,600 kg), and would have been 8 ft (2.4 m) tall.
> If a moth flew into this, it would just die. So we wouldn't have any bugs.
- Babbage even designed a printer for the Difference Engine.

### Analytical Engine

- Before the construction of the Difference Engine began, he started working on Analytical Engine.
- Difference Engine was meant for a mechanized computation. But Analytical Engine could handle any
  computation, making it a general purpose computer.
- It was programmed using punch cards. It allowed for sequential control, looping, and branching.
- Despite the importance of his work, the analytical engine was unknown to the builders of the
  electromechanical and electronic computing machines in 1930s and 1940s. J. Presper Eckert and John
  W. Mauchly similarly were not aware of the details of Babbage's analytical engine work prior to
  the completion of their design for the first electronic general-purpose computer, the ENIAC.
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine

### Notes

- Vannevar Bush's paper Instrumental Analysis (1936) included several references to Babbage's work.
  In the same year he started the Rapid Arithmetical Machine project to investigate the problems of
  constructing an electronic digital computer.

## Ada Lovelace

- She was born in 1815. 2 months after she was born, her parents got a divorce.
- Her mother was afraid that she would develop the insanities of her father, so she promoted Ada's
  interest in mathematics and logic.
- She married William King in 1835, and after he became Earl of Lovelace, she became the Countess.
- Her educational and social connections helped her be acquainted by a lot of influential
  characters, for example Charles Babbage, Micheal Faraday and Charles Dickens.
- Her interest and talent in mathematics led her to Charles Babbage. She first met Babbage in one of
  his soirees.
- Babbage was thinking of the Analytical Engine as essentially a glorified calculator. But Ada saw
  that if those numbers could represent other things, much more could be created.
> The Analytical Engine might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual
> fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which
> should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of
> the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the
> science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations,
> the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or
> extent.
>
> From Doron Swade
>
> Ada saw something that Babbage in some sense failed to see. In Babbage's world his engines were
> bound by number...What Lovelace saw...was that number could represent entities other than
> quantity. So once you had a machine for manipulating numbers, if those numbers represented other
> things, letters, musical notes, then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one
> instance, according to rules. It is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number
> cruncher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental
> transition from calculation to computation—to general-purpose computation—and looking back from
> the present high ground of modern computing, if we are looking and sifting history for that
> transition, then that transition was made explicitly by Ada in that 1843 paper.
- There are some controversy over her contributions. Babbage apparently had the early programs for
  the Analytical Engine.
- Programming language Ada is named after her.
```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Hello_World is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, world!");
end Hello_World;
```
