# Presentation Style

- Link to Kate Gergory's Am I a Good Programmer talk.
- Include an honorable mentions list for each area.
- When there's too many things to mention for a person, put all those things in something like a
  word bubble. We can show that interactively on the slides.

# Random Notes

- "Software is not a product of a single brain, it's a cooperative effort." - Dennis Ritchie.
> This is a good quote to use for the slides.
