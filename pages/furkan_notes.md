# Presentation Style

- Link to Kate Gergory's Am I a Good Programmer talk.
- Include an honorable mentions list for each area.
- When there's too many things to mention for a person, put all those things in something like a
  word bubble. We can show that interactively on the slides.

# Random Notes

- "Software is not a product of a single brain, it's a cooperative effort." - Dennis Ritchie.
> This is a good quote to use for the slides.

> Maybe don't include it, I couldn't find the source for this...
- Finish with the programming languages area so we can tie it to C++.
- "We are going to show you rather than tell you how these innovations touched our lives."

- Add a resources and references section for people to learn more.
- "I'd like to pause and imagine all the things that had to have happened for me to end up here.
  This is what we are going to do today."

# Notes

## Charles Babbage

- The Difference Engine was designed by him but it was never built because the machinist responsible
  for building the machine refused to do it unless he was prepaid.
> Q: How much money did he ask for? Why didn't he get the money?
- He later designed the Analytical Engine. This was an even bigger and more complicated machine. It
  was steam run and operated by one person.
> The memory unit was to be large enough to hold 1,000 50-digit numbers; this was larger than the
> storage capacity of any computer built before 1960.
- Analytical Engine was never built either. The design was forgotten until his unpublished notes
  were discovered in 1937.
- He was part of [The Ghost Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_Club). It seems that this
  club is still "active" in their investigations.
