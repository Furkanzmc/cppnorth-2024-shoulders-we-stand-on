# John McCarthy (1927-2011)

## The Father of Artificial Intelligence

- <span v-mark.underline.pink>**Time-sharing**</span>: Innovated the concept of sharing computing resources among multiple users.
- <span v-mark.underline.pink>**Lisp (1958)**</span>: One of the earliest high-level programming languages, influencing modern languages and AI research.
- <span v-mark.underline.pink>**Artificial Intelligence**</span>: Coined the term "AI" in 1955
<br>  

  "AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world."

# Edsger W. Dijkstra (1930-2002)

## "A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs" (1959)

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Introduced for shortest paths, fundamental in network routing, GIS, and optimization.
- **Structured Programming**: Advocated for principles leading to reliable and maintainable software.
  - “A Case against the GO TO Statement” (EWD215)
  - Coined: “2 or more, use a for”
- **Distributed Programming**: Early pioneer with contributions like self-stabilizing systems and semaphores.
