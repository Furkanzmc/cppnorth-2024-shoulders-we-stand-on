## Vint Cerf & Robert Kahn

** Fathers of the Internet**

- Co-design of the TCP/IP protocols (1973)
- Enabled different networks to communicate, creating the "internet"
- Simplified data transmission and scalability

<!-- 
- 'fathers of the Internet.' 
- Their development of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP) was pivotal in creating a global communication network that we now know as the Internet.

- The TCP/IP protocols are essential b/c they ensure that data is reliably transmitted across networks. 
- TCP manages the breakdown and reassembly of data packets, 
- while IP handles the addressing and routing of these packets to their correct destinations"

- This enabled different networks to interconnect, creating a 'network of networks.' 
- Provided the scalability and flexibility needed for the rapid expansion of the Internet.

- Note: Cerf was inspired by Robert Noyce’s innovations and culture of innovation, went on to co-design TCP/IP protocols with Rohbert Kahn

<!-- 
- In the early 1970s, the concept of interconnected computer networks was in its infancy
- Cerf and Kahn met in the early 1970s
  - Kahn, who was working on ARPANET, envisioned an open-architecture network
  - He collaborated with Cerf, who was an expert in networking protocols, to bring this vision to life.
- Challenge: The existing networks were heterogeneous and could not easily communicate with one another
  - There was a need for interconnectivity between diverse computer systems
- To address these challenges, Cerf and Kahn developed TCP/IP
  - Enabled different networks to communicate effectively
  - Provided the scalability and flexibility necessary for the Internet’s growth

- The Problem
  - Centralized platforms control user data
  - Privacy concerns and data misuse
  - Limited interoperability between services

- Proposed solution
  - Aims to reshape the way web applications work by giving users more control over their personal data. 
  - Instead of storing data in centralized servers owned by companies, Solid allows users to store their data in personal online data stores (Pods) that they control. 
  - This means users can decide who accesses their data and for what purposes.

- Solid's Vision: Decentralization, interoperability, user empowerment. Open Source.
