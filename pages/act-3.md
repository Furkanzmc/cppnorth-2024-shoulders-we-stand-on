# Grace Hopper

<!--
- Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the
  first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944 and invented the first compiler for a
  computer programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming
  languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still
  in use today.
