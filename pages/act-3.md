# Grace Hopper

> AKA "Amazing Grace" AKA "Grandma COBOL"

<!--
- Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the
  first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944 and invented the first compiler for a
  computer programming language. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming
  languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still
  in use today.

- She was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. You can see from the Letterman video that
  she was great at explaining complex ideas in a simple way.

# FLOW-MATIC

```
1. OUTPUT 'HELLO, WORLD' TO CONSOLE.
2. STOP.
```

::right::

# COBOL

```
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO-WORLD.
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY 'HELLO, WORLD'.
    STOP RUN.
```

<!--
- FLOW-MATIC was the first English-like data processing language.
- COBOL was specifically created for business applications, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs.
- It uses English-like syntax to make it more readable and self-documenting.
- Created in 1959, COBOL has been in use for over 60 years.
- It has adapted to changing business needs and technological advancements over the decades.
- COBOL was designed to be portable across different computer systems, which was revolutionary at the time.

<!--
- With COBOL, she also implemented the first compiler.
- She advocated for standardization of programming languages, and machine independence.
- She considers building the first compiler as her greatest achievement, other than teaching young
  people.
